# BeeD
## Introduction
Bee-D is an ultra-small maker artifact developed by the DBD team. It is only 50mm x 38mm in size. It uses a 32-bit processor with an ARM Cortex-M0 core, a main frequency of 80MHz, a built-in dual-channel stepper motor driver, and runs a space vector control algorithm and a dynamic torque adjustment algorithm. It can perfectly control two 42 and below low-power stepper motors. Bee-D is small and exquisite, with rich interfaces, including 2 IO input interfaces, 2 motor interfaces, and 2 485 communication interfaces. Bee-D has simplified the operation mode, only retaining the synchronous interpolation position mode, the zero return mode, and the smooth position mode, which is suitable for the application of multi-channel lightweight stepper control.
